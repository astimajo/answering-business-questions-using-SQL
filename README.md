# answering-business-questions-using-SQL

In this project we attempt to answer common business questions like
which customer has the most purchases, which products to add or invest in
based on purchases and demand on a country.

In this project we exercise the use of complex queries, and intermediate
SQL concepts like common table expressions, joins, subqueries, views etc.
